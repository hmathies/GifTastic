<h3>Description</h3>
Let's face it- Giphy images make people smile!  This web application allows you to search from the Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com/) to find any giphy you can think of.  The giphy will be rendered to the page as a still image.  Just click on the image to see it animated.
